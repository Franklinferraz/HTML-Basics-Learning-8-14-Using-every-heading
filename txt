Using every heading
Nice work!

Given that there are six heading sizes altogether, we should make use of all six.

Instructions
Add three more headings to the code, making use of <h2>, <h4> and <h6>. 
Make sure to close all your tags!
Under each heading, add a short paragraph. 
Dont forget paragraphs need opening and closing <p></p> tags!
